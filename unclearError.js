The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the provided credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during the sign-in process.  Specifically, the error message might not be descriptive enough to pinpoint the exact cause, leading to debugging challenges. For example, a generic "auth/network-request-failed" error can mask various underlying problems like incorrect API keys, missing internet connectivity, or server-side issues within Firebase.
